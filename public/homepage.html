        <p>Chinese ghost culture originated in primitive society. With the development of history, ghost culture has also experienced a process of continuous enrichment, variation, and renewal.

        <p>
          Before Western Zhou, ghosts and gods were not separated. In our ancestors’ opinion, all the people become ghosts after death. Similar to humans, there are also good ghosts and bad ghosts. Through the classification of ghosts, people reflect their feelings in real life into this religious-like early consciousness. <br>>>

        <a href="ghosts-buddhism.html">
        <p>After the Han dynasty, Buddhism was introduced in China. Since there are many teachings about hells, it gradually merged with the “nine underground stories” of Chinese traditional ghost culture and the feudal official system to create a localized “Ten Yamas of Hell”, which provides supporting relief for the people at the bottom of a hierarchical society. In addition, many Buddhist classics have integrated ghosts and gods with reincarnation after localization, and then developed new Buddhist stories and teachings. <br> >>

        <a href="ghosts-taoism.html">
        <p>The widespread popularity of Taoism has also prompted the Chinese ghost culture to include ghosts, gods, and immortals. In addition, Taoism has also absorbed the “Shen Ren”, “Zhi Ren”, and “Zhen Ren” in Laozi and Zhuangzi’s philosophy. In order to cater to people's desire to become immortals, a complete system of immortals is constructed. Since then, the boundaries of ghosts, gods, and immortals became blurry. <br> >>

        <p>In the late stage of the development of Chinese ghost culture, it was gradually used by literati and painters to reveal the social darkness and satirize the social problems at that time. Literati, such as the "Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou", made the ghost culture a carrier for them to express their emotions and ambitions. <br> >></p>
