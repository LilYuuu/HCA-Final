              <h3><i>The Skeleton Fantasy</i></h3>
              <p>Li Song, Southern Song, The National Palace Museum.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="artifact-intro">
            <p>The central figure in the picture is a large skeleton sitting on the floor, with his right hand controlling a small skeleton, which should be a puppet. Opposite the little skull is a child, raising his head and stretching out his right arm, as if to reach out to catch the little skull. The young woman behind the child seems a little anxious while the young woman behind the big skull is carrying a baby in her arms and watching what was in front of her serenely. The depiction of the characters is vivid and detailed, especially the shape of the skull.</p>

            <p>The core theme of the painting is the transformation of life and death and the cycle of cause and effect. This picture also has a phantom structure of two manipulations: the big skeleton's manipulation of the small skeleton, and the invisible hand's manipulation of the big skeleton. The controversy of the identity of the big skeleton is continuously discussed and never has a conclusion. During the Song and Yuan Dynasties, the skull is a bantering metaphor about people. Taoist idea of homogeneity and enjoying death, and Buddhist idea of dying and nirvana are the ideological origins of the Skeleton Fantasy. The painting shows Li Songâ€™s personal interesting painting style and reflects the ideological origin.</p>
