              <p>Luo Pin, Qing Dynasty, The National Palace Museum.</p>

          <div class="artifact-intro">
            <p>Zhong Kui in the picture was drunk, pacing forward with the help of the kid. The characters are vivid and interesting. The painter uses comic techniques to depict a strange and weird world of ghosts and monsters, which satirizes social reality. Some people compare this picture to Pu Songling's "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio", saying that they all use ghosts to represent people to satirize the world.</p>
            <p>Zhong Kui is a famous deity associated with ghosts. Ancient books record that he was initially a native of Yongzhou in the early Tang Dynasty. He was born with a leopard head and eyes, iron face, and an ugly appearance. However, he was a talent, who was generally righteous and upright, and treated people with integrity and courage.
            According to legend, the emperor Tang Xuanzong suddenly fell seriously ill after going out on a parade. Many therapies were tried but useless. The emperor was very anxious. One night, he dreamed that a little ghost in a red dress had stolen his treasure, and the emperor angrily rebuked the little ghost. Suddenly, a big ghost appeared, caught the little ghost and ate it into his stomach. The emperor asked him who he was, and the big ghost replied: “I am Zhong Kui, originally a scholar from the south. I was annoyed and killed myself on the steps of the palace because the emperor refused to admit me due to my ugly appearance. After my death, I  engaged in ghost hunting”. After Xuanzong woke up, he recovered from the illness and named Zhong Kui as a blessing sage, specializing in hunting ghosts.

            <p>The picture depicts Zhong Kui parade surrounded by the ghost clan on a rainy night. In the painting, seven ghost pawns with cow heads and horse faces and Mongolian army helmets. They are beating the drums and wielding weapons to surround Zhong Kui's.  Zhong Kui’s night tour seems to be overwhelming. The painting expresses the painter's contempt and hatred towards the Mongolian ruler. </p>
            <p>Yan Hui’s brushwork is vigorous, solid, simple and smooth. His style is vivid and his mood is comfortable being both artistic and rational.
              In terms of painting method, Yan Hui can make detailed meticulous depictions, but in most cases, he would like to make thick ink brushes with vigor and boldness. The characters are peculiar in shape and outstanding in character. The brushwork is thick and the thickness of the hooks is appropriate. The picture sets off the dark and concave, rich in three-dimensional feeling. It is called "exquisite brushwork, being artistic everywhere", which is a kind of unprecedented innovative painting method.

            <p>
              There are many folk legends of Zhong Kui, one of the most famous is "Zhong Kui Giving His Sister Away in Marriage". The story is that Zhong Kui led 300 ghost soldiers and ghosts to go home overnight to visit his sister Zhong Hua after he was granted the title. He knocked on the door, and Zhong Hua hurriedly opened the door with joy. Seeing a ghost standing in front of her, she was so scared that she closed the door. Zhong Kui complained bitterly, then Zhong Hua opened the door and recognized her elder brother. Zhong Kui chose a good family for his sister to marry her, and led the ghosts to give her away. Besides paintings, this story also appeared in many local operas in China.
            </p>

            <p>The picture is a classic of the story of Zhong Kui leading his sister to her new home. It is a long scroll composition with Zhong Kui and his sister in the middle in a sedan chair. The little ghosts are around them, with various dowries in their hands and on their shoulders, making it lively. The female ghost in the picture, whose facial rouge is replaced by ink, looks humorous and interesting.</p>

            <p>Here, the legendary "demon queller" Zhong Kui leads his sister to her new home accompanied by an escort of demons performing feats of martial prowess. The comic climax to this spectacle is Zhong Kui himself—stone drunk and propped atop a small donkey by three retainers while his sister sits helplessly astride a recalcitrant water buffalo.</p>
            <p>Yan Geng may have derived inspiration from actual New Year's processions, during which costumed figures impersonating Zhong Kui and his band of demons circulated through neighborhoods and banished evil in return for payment. Paintings on this subject clearly enjoyed widespread appeal, perhaps serving as auspicious gifts for the New Year.</p>
