              <h3><i>Ghost Album</i></h3>
              <p>Luo Pin, Qing Dynasty.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="artifact-intro">
            <p>The ghosts in the Ghost Album are all animal-like, with ox horns and tiger teeth. The face looks fierce and the weapons in their hands are threatening. The ghosts are like monsters with strong bodies, which leads people to revoke the idea of Shanhai Jing, a classic recording ancient Chinese fables and tales. Considering other painters’ painting of animal-like ghosts, it is surprising that these ghosts have many similarities, like ox horns, tiger teeth and horse-like legs. This may be because the ghosts in folk tales were always depicted like this, so in people’s imagination, the ghosts are in this kind of form. The eight figures in the Ghost Album are vivid with different postures, holding weapons respectively. Luo Pin is good at painting the dynamic condition of figures, which makes the audience be curious about what they are doing and what their stories are.

              <p>Luo Pin, Qing. National Art Museum of China.</p>

          <div class="artifact-intro">
            <p>In the first picture, in a cloud of smoke, some bizarre faces and limbs can be vaguely seen. The ethereal image is exactly a "ghost". In the second picture, there are two ghosts on the screen: one after the other, moving forward quickly. They were probably a pair of ghost masters and servants. The third picture is a gorgeously dressed and hateful "rich ghost". It holds an orchid in his hand and is whispering to a female ghost, while another ghost is eavesdropping. The fourth picture shows a dwarf ghost, leaning on a cane, and a red smaller ghost is holding a wine bowl for him. The fifth picture is of a green-haired ghost with long legs and arms, making an arrest. The sixth picture is a big ghost, chasing two little ghosts running in front. The two little ghosts looked back in a panic while running. In the seventh picture, a total of four ghosts are drawn. A ghost holding an umbrella rushed through the wind and rain and closely following the ghost in front. The eighth picture shows two skeletons, a man and a woman, standing and talking next to an ancient tomb among the trees.</p>

            <p>Ghosts in this painting are different from the hideous and terrifying image in folklore. It uses a combination of realism and exaggeration to create a vivid artistic image according to the public's aesthetic psychological needs, rendering and setting off the unique situation of the ghost domain, with outstanding personality and demeanor.</p>

            <p>Luo Pin used a unique technique when drawing "Ghost Fun Map", which is to wet the entire drawing paper with water and then paint. Painting on wet paper requires complex skills, and the priority of pen strokes is the key. Luo Pin's wet paper painting method is used properly, and the whole picture is full of a cold atmosphere.</p>
