              <h3><i>Yongle Palace Murals</i></h3>
              <p>Yuan Dynasty, Shanxi Province.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="artifact-intro">
            <p>The murals painted on the west, north and east walls of the Sanqing Hall, or the Three Taoist Saints Hall, cover more than 400 square meters, depicting a grand scene of congregation of Taoist saints and more than 280 other figures. The Yongle Palace murals use traditional stylistic painting methods so that nearly 300 images have no similarity, which is really amazing.
              The murals here demonstrate the superb Taoist painting techniques that had been inherited from Tang Dynasty (AD 618-907) and Song Dynasty (960-1279). The figure painting here reminds viewers of the ethereal style of Wu Daozi (AD 680-759), a legendary artist of Tang Dynasty. Today, the murals in Yongle Palace are not only cherished as a rare gem in the world of art, but also treasured sources for studying Taoism, Chinaâ€™s only indigenous religion. Judging from the relics of ancient Chinese paintings discovered so far, there are very few large-scale figure paintings from the Yuan Dynasty. The murals can be used as an example of studying and learning of Yuan Dynasty paintings.
